Developed by 4 students themselves, the resources were chosen by the students’ preferences. In total, the website compiles 5 mental health resources for use based on user preference. The website also includes a “home” and “about us” page to greet the user and to give them a better understanding of who made the website. The creator’s emails can also be found on the about us page, so they can be contacted at any time.
